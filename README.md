# Project Title: Calculator App Automation 

## Project Summary

This project automates the testing of a mobile calculator application using Appium and IntelliJ. The framework is designed to handle both parameter-based and CSV-driven test cases for various calculation series.

### Key Features

1. **Series Calculation Method**
   - A reusable function that automates any calculation series passed as a parameter. For example:
     ```java
     public void doSeries() {
         calculateSeries("100/10*5-10+60");
     }
     ```
   - This function simulates user input on the calculator app by iterating through the series string, identifying digits and operators, and triggering the corresponding button actions.

2. **CSV-Based Calculation Validation**
   - A function that reads calculation series from a CSV file and automates assertions for each series.
   - Example CSV content:
     ```
     Series, Expected Result
     50+40-30/2+20, 95
     10*2/2+10-20, 0
     4pi2^3, 100.53
     ```
   - Each series tests different operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation.
